  <h1 id="what-is-symbolic-execution">What is symbolic execution?</h1>
<p>One might relate it to symbolic equations from mathematics in school. A few exambles of symbolic equations might be:</p>
<pre><code>a²+b²=c²
E=hf
F=ma
</code></pre><p>These are examples of symbolic equations. Values are defined based on symbols we call different things. For the symbols we could define constraints, eg. &ldquo;f&rdquo; must be larger than 0. or &ldquo;a&rdquo; is equal to 9.82 N/kg. Thus minimizing the amount of results or outcomes.

In computer science symbolic execution instead is a way of analyzing a program to see which inputs causes which execution branches to be run. Instead of using actual inputs, however, we use an interpreter which assumes symbolic values.</p>
<h1 id="example-stolen-from-wikipedia">Example (stolen from wikipedia)</h1>
<p>Example code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">f</span>() {
  ...
  y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> read();
  z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>;
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (z <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>) {
    fail();
  } <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> {
    printf(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;OK&#34;</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Concrete:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Upon executing the example code with a concrete input. The read() call on line 3, would read a concrete value, eg. <code>5</code>. It would then run the program throughout with that value. Z would be set to 10, and &ldquo;OK&rdquo; would be printed. We would now not know how fail would be called. Which we for explanation sake want.</p>
<p>Symbolic:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Executing with symbolic input. The read() would read a symbolic value eg. <code>µ</code> the program would then continue execution with this value, z would now be able to be any value, as we did not define a value for µ. When it reaches the <code>if (z==12)</code>, it can just say &ldquo;sure! z is 12 lol&rdquo;, and forks this as a new process with the other else statement. If a program is large enough, this becomes infeasible, because there&rsquo;ll be too many paths - this is called a path explosion.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-angr-stolen-from-documentation">What is angr (stolen from documentation)</h1>
<p>Angr is a python framework for analyzing binaries. It can do automatic ROP-chaining, binary hardening, automatic exploit generation, and finally but probably most known for, it&rsquo;s symbolic execution.</p>
<p>Angr recommends installing in a virtual environment as follows:</p>
<pre><code>mkvirtualenv angr
pip install angr
</code></pre><p>or using the provided docker container.</p>
<p>I for one, however just installed it &ldquo;normally&rdquo;, using pip.</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install angr
</code></pre>
